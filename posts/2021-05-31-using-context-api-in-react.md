Data is often passed to react components using props, whether as a single component or components with one or more
children components. This can be very cumbersome for global variables or properties like current logged-in user,
user locale, theme etc. React context provide us with an API to pass data across all components without having to
pass props from grand-parent to parent and then to child.

I often see devs try to use a state container like Redux to solve this problem but then end up with a more complex
solution of creating a store, initial state and then passing state value down to components using `mapStateToProps`.

The context API offers us a clean and re-usable way of passing global variables across all components in our
application.

## Creating Context

Say we wanted to create a global context for handling currently authenticated user. We start by creating a file
named `UserContext.js` with the content below:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const UserContext = React.createContext(null);

export const UserProvider = UserContext.Provider;
export const UserConsumer = UserContext.Consumer;

export default UserContext;
```

The code above create a React context `UserContext` and gives us a `Provider` and a `Consumer`.
`Provider` as the name implies is the component that provides the value that will be accessed globally by other
components while `Consumer` is a component that has direct access to the global variable.

`React.createContext` takes a `defaultValue` as you can see above. In our case, we set the `defaultValue` to
`null`. The `defaultValue` is only used when the `Consumer` can not find a matching `Provider` above the component
tree. This is mostly useful during testing when you don't want to wrap your components in a `Provider`{% sidenote
'context-undefined-default-value' 'Passing `undefined` as the `defaultValue` does not cause the consuming components to
use this value. ' %}.

## Providing Context

No matter how you choose to consume a context value, the context `Provider` must always be a parent of the
components consuming the context value. The `Provider` takes `value` as props and this value is passed down to all
descendent components that subscribe to the context value via a `Consumer`.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Home from './Home';
import { UserProvider } from './UserContext';

function App() {
  const user = { name: 'Oshomo Oforomeh' };
  const value = { user };

  return (
    <UserProvider value={value}>
      <Home />
    </UserProvider>
  );
}
```

Now the `user` will ve available to the `HomePage` component and its children, grand-children and
great-grand-children. You need to be careful how you update and manage the `Provider` value, because a change to the
`user` will cause a re-render of all the components consuming the `Provider` value.

## Consuming Context

Unlike the `Provider` the way you consume a context is not the same for class and functional components. I will show
you how to use the `Consumer` to subscribe to a context and access the `Provider` value.

### Class Components

The easiest way to consume a context in a class component is to use the static `contextType` property on the class.
Using this property let you consume the nearest context `Provider` value using `this.context`. `this.context` can be
used in all component lifecycle including the `render` method.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import UserContext from './UserContext';

class Home extends React.Component {
  static contextType = UserContext;

  componentDidMount() {
    const { user } = this.context;
    console.log(user); // { name: 'Oshomo Oforomeh' }
  }

  render() {
    const { user } = this.context;
    return <div>{user.name}</div>;
  }
}
```

Note that `static contextType = UserContext` assumes that you are using the experimental public class field{%
sidenote 'public-class-field-explanation' 'Both public and private field declarations are an experimental feature
(stage 3) proposed at TC39, the JavaScript standards committee.<br /><br />Support in browsers is limited, but the
feature can be used through a build step with systems like Babel.'%}. If you are not, then use the code sample below
instead.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import UserContext from './UserContext';

class Home extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    const { user } = this.context;
    console.log(user); // { name: 'Oshomo Oforomeh' }
  }

  render() {
    const { user } = this.context;
    return <div>{user.name}</div>;
  }
}

Home.contextType = UserContext;
```

The static `contextType` has one drawback, it doesn't allow a class component to consume multiple providers. To
consume multiple providers in a class component, we wrap our component with the `Consumer` component. The `Consumer`
component take a function that returns a React component as children. The function receives the context value like
below. This method can also be used when consuming a single `Provider`.

Consuming single provider with `Consumer`.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { UserConsumer } from './UserContext';

class Home extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <UserConsumer>
        {({ user }) => {
          return <div>{user.name}</div>;
        }}
      </UserConsumer>
    );
  }
}
```

Consuming multiple provider with `Consumer`.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { UserConsumer } from './UserContext';
import { ThemeConsumer } from './ThemeContext';

class Home extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeConsumer>
        {(theme) => (
          <UserConsumer>
            {({ user }) => {
              return (
                <div>
                  <span>{theme.color}</span>
                  <span>{user.name}</span>
                </div>
              );
            }}
          </UserConsumer>
        )}
      </ThemeConsumer>
    );
  }
}
```

### Functional Components & Hooks

Functional components are much simpler, whether you are consuming one or multiple provider. With functional
components we use the `useContext` hook which is equivalent to the static `contextType` we used in the class
component. The only difference is we can use multiple hooks in a functional component, thus giving us the ability
to consume multiple provider with ease.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import UserContext from './UserContext';

const Home = () => {
  const { user } = React.useContext(UserContext);
  // You can add as much context as you want
  // const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);

  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
};
```

## Updating Context

Sometimes you might want to update the context value from a deeply nested component down the tree, like
changing a theme from light to dark and vice versa.

In this case, you can pass a function down through the context value to allow consumers update context values using
this function. Let us make an update to our initial
context provider:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const UserContext = React.createContext({
  user: null,
  updateUser: () => {},
});

export const UserProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, updateUser] = React.useState(null);
  const value = { user, updateUser };

  return <UserContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</UserContext.Provider>;
};

export const UserConsumer = UserContext.Consumer;

export default UserContext;
```

Now we can get the user value from the context as we did before as well as update the user value in the context like
below:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import UserContext from './UserContext';

const Home = () => {
  const { user, updateUser } = React.useContext(UserContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => updateUser({ name: 'Oshomo Updated' })}>Update User</button>
      <p>{`Current User: ${user.name}`}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

Use `React.createContext()` to create context and get the `Provider` and `Consumer` from the created context.

I advise you wrap `Provider` in a parent component so you can easily manage `Provider` value.

You can consume a context in a class by using `static contextType = Context` inside the class or `Class.contextType = Context`.

To consume multiple context in a class, wrap you component in `<Context.Consumer>{component}</Context.Consumer>`.

You can consume one or more context in a functional component by using `React.useContext(Context)`.
